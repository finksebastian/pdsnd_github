I added some checks to avoid crashing on gender and birth year data if the corresponding columns are not available in the data
I looked up a few things on stackoverflow (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24870306/how-to-check-if-a-column-exists-in-pandas/39371897)
I looked up options for formatting (https://mkaz.blog/code/python-string-format-cookbook/)
I had some fun to make the user input easier, it is possible to use shortened input as long as it is unambiguous.
